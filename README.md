# FitnessApp

This was a school (SKP - skolepraktik) project.

This was a group project and we needed to make - an mobile app, simple SPA, Rest API and host it all. I was given task to create the app and was helping creating API. The idea was to make a fitness app which can help user with workouts.</br>

This App was made in React Native and data was send/received by API (made in ASP.Net ) which was hosted on IIS server.

### System requirements were: </br>
* Users can create and then login with their accounts
* Measure the user's progress (body size, weight, etc.)
* User can choose between the training types
* Recommended training exercises
* Weekly plan (Training of specific body part)
* Training logbook
* Training instructions
* Training exercises top score 

Users can choose between 3 workout types - Weight (here user can also choose exercises for different muscle groups), Cardio or Calisthenics training and see a lists with many different exercises.
Users need have an account which they can easelly create and use to login. Users can see and edit they personal info and passwords inside app. Users can make their own weekly training plan also edit them and delete.
Users can create their personal best / record for all exercises and see, edit and delete them.

Here you can see how it looks:
