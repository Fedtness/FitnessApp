# FitnessApp

This was a school (SKP - skolepraktik) project.

The idea was to make a fitness app which can help user with workouts.</br>

Users can choose between 3 workout types - Weight (here user can also choose exercises for different muscle groups), Cardio or Calisthenics training and see a lists with many different exercises.
Users need have an account which they can easelly create and use to login. Users can see and edit they personal info and passwords inside app. Users can make their own weekly training plan also edit them and delete.
Users can create their personal best / record for all exercises and see, edit and delete them.
